The lab has been completed, however I did not have enough time to fully test
and come across any bugs, however with my limited testing I have found no errors.

It accomplishes all the types of commands specified within the lab manual without 
problem as far as I can tell.

I could not determine a more efficient method as midterms are soon and I need to
space out my time management.
